title: Quickstart
description: Install Open Interpreter, open a project, and run your first coding-agent session.
---

Open Interpreter is a terminal coding agent built from the Codex CLI surface and
adapted for provider-agnostic local use. It can inspect your repository, edit
files, run commands, review diffs, and resume work later.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://www.openinterpreter.com/install | sh
    ```

    On Windows, run:

    ```powershell
    irm https://www.openinterpreter.com/install.ps1 | iex
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open a project">
    ```bash
    cd my-project
    i
    ```

    `i` is the short command for `interpreter`; either command starts an
    interactive session.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a provider">
    The first run walks you through provider setup. You can sign in with
    ChatGPT, use an API key, connect a local model through Ollama or LM Studio,
    or configure another compatible provider.

    You can change providers later with `/model`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask for a change">
    Type a concrete request:

    ```text
    add a /health endpoint that returns the build sha
    ```

    Open Interpreter reads the project, proposes work, edits files, and runs
    commands through the active sandbox and approval settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve actions">
    In the default local workflow, Open Interpreter can work inside the current
    workspace and asks before actions that need more access. Use `/permissions`
    to inspect or change this during a session.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resume later">
    ```bash
    interpreter resume --last
    ```

    Resume keeps the prior conversation, context, and working directory.
  </Step>
</Steps>
