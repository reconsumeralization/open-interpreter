description: How Open Interpreter uses shared agent standards and avoids product lock-in.
---

Open Interpreter's goal is to participate in a shared agent ecosystem, not
create a private island of instructions, skills, and workflows. When a
practical cross-tool standard exists, Open Interpreter should read it directly
and preserve it in a form other compatible tools can use.

This is a product direction and an engineering constraint. It is not a claim
that every kind of runtime state already has a universal format.

## Principles

- Prefer established, tool-neutral protocols and directory conventions over
  Open Interpreter-specific equivalents.
- Keep user-authored instructions, skills, and configuration readable and
  inspectable.
- Read shared content in place instead of requiring an import or private copy.
- Keep compatibility readers for legacy product paths during migrations.
- Make export and migration possible when no shared live format exists.
- Reserve product-specific storage for secrets, caches, indexes, logs, and
  runtime state that cannot yet be represented safely by a shared standard.

## Current Shared Surface

| Capability | Shared surface |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| Project instructions | `AGENTS.md` |
| Project skills | `.agents/skills/` |
| Personal skills | `~/.agents/skills/` |
| Tool integrations | Model Context Protocol (MCP) |
| Editor and client integration | Agent Client Protocol (ACP) |
| Programmatic execution | Codex-compatible exec protocol |

These locations and protocols should work without converting the user's data
into an Open Interpreter-only representation.

## Product-Specific State

Open Interpreter currently keeps configuration, credentials, session history,
logs, caches, and daemon state under `~/.openinterpreter` or the operating
system credential store. Some of that state is inherently product-specific;
some may move to a shared standard when a safe and broadly adopted one exists.

The legacy `~/.openinterpreter/skills/` directory remains readable so existing
setups do not break. Shared `~/.agents/skills/` is the preferred home for new
personal skills.

## What This Means for Changes

Before adding a new product-owned file format or directory, first check whether
an established agent, editor, or operating-system standard can represent the
same data. If a product-specific format is still necessary:

1. Use plain, documented data where practical.
2. Keep the boundary narrow.
3. Provide a migration or export path for user-authored data.
4. Avoid making the product-specific copy the only usable source of truth.

The test for a portable feature is simple: a user should be able to understand
where their data lives, reuse the standardized parts with another compatible
tool, and leave Open Interpreter without losing user-authored work.
