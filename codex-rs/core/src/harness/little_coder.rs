const READ_WRITE_TOOL_GUIDANCE: &str = r#"## Tool Usage Guidance

### Read
## Read Tool
Read a file's contents with line numbers.

REQUIRED: path (absolute path)
OPTIONAL: limit (max lines), offset (start line, 0-indexed)

RULES:
- Always use absolute paths, never relative
- Use limit+offset for large files (read in chunks of 100-200 lines)
- Returns format: "N\tline_content" (tab-separated line number + content)

EXAMPLE:
```tool
{"name": "Read", "input": {"path": "/absolute/path/to/file.py"}}
```

EXAMPLE with range:
```tool
{"name": "Read", "input": {"path": "/absolute/path/to/file.py", "limit": 50, "offset": 100}}
```

### Write
## Write Tool
Create a **new** file with the given content. Creates parent directories automatically.

REQUIRED: path (absolute), content (full file content)

**Write is for creating new files only.** If the file already exists, Write will be **refused** by the tool and return an error telling you to use Edit instead. Do not retry Write on the same path — it will be refused again.

WHEN TO USE Write:
- The file does not exist yet and you are creating it from scratch

WHEN TO USE Edit INSTEAD:
- ANY change to an existing file — bug fixes, refactors, format tweaks, adding a function, renaming a variable, everything. Edit takes `path` + `edits: [{oldText, newText}]` and patches in place.
- Iterating after a failed test — never retype the whole file

If you need to completely replace an existing file's content, Edit can still do that: pass the entire current content as `oldText` and the full new content as `newText`. Read the file first if you don't already have its current content.

EXAMPLE:
```tool
{"name": "Write", "input": {"path": "/tmp/example/new_module.py", "content": "def hello():\n    return 'hi'\n"}}
```
NOTE: Always use the EXACT file path given in the task, never a placeholder.

### Workspace Documentation
Before writing code for a non-trivial task, check if the workspace has a problem specification or convention document. These are cheap to read and often contain the exact format rules, edge cases, or constraints the tests assert — which the model would otherwise have to reverse-engineer from tests alone. Look for (in priority order): `.docs/instructions.md` and `.docs/instructions.append.md` (exercism-style problem specs), `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` (agent-specific instructions at repo root), `README.md` in the current directory, `SPEC.md` / `SPECIFICATION.md`, and `docs/*.md`. Use Glob to discover them (`*.md`, `.docs/*.md`, `AGENTS.md`) and Read the relevant one. Do this ONCE at the start of a task, not every turn. If the spec disambiguates a failing test (e.g. "the first and last elements must match" or "spaces and punctuation are excluded"), that single read saves many debug iterations. Skip for pure read-only questions — only invest the Read call when you are about to change code.


## Tool Usage Guidance

### Glob
## Glob Tool
Find files matching a glob pattern.

REQUIRED: pattern (glob pattern like "**/*.py")
OPTIONAL: path (directory to search in, defaults to cwd)

RULES:
- Use ** for recursive matching across directories
- Returns sorted list of matching file paths
- Good for finding files by extension or name pattern

EXAMPLE:
```tool
{"name": "Glob", "input": {"pattern": "**/*.py"}}
```

EXAMPLE with path:
```tool
{"name": "Glob", "input": {"pattern": "*.md", "path": "/path/to/docs/"}}
```

### Read
## Read Tool
Read a file's contents with line numbers.

REQUIRED: path (absolute path)
OPTIONAL: limit (max lines), offset (start line, 0-indexed)

RULES:
- Always use absolute paths, never relative
- Use limit+offset for large files (read in chunks of 100-200 lines)
- Returns format: "N\tline_content" (tab-separated line number + content)

EXAMPLE:
```tool
{"name": "Read", "input": {"path": "/absolute/path/to/file.py"}}
```

EXAMPLE with range:
```tool
{"name": "Read", "input": {"path": "/absolute/path/to/file.py", "limit": 50, "offset": 100}}
```

## Research-first directive
This task involves online research. Before producing a final answer:
1. Use BrowserNavigate / BrowserExtract (or WebSearch for first hops) to gather facts.
2. Save each citable fact via EvidenceAdd before relying on it.
3. Only after evidence is in place should you consider any Edit/Write tool calls.
Skipping the gather step (going straight to Edit/Write or guessing from memory) is wrong — restart with the browse step instead.
